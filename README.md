# SuperStore Analytics Project

In this project we have taken a global superstore dataset which consists of 3 tables namely orders, returns and people.

We have have performed data cleaning and data modelling using Microsoft Excel, Power BI and Power Query Editor(DAX).

A Dynamic Dashboard is created that provides meaningful insights like sales by segment, top 6 profitable customers ..year wise
