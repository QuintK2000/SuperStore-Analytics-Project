# SuperStore Analytics Project

In this project we have taken a global superstore dataset which consists of 3 tables namely orders, returns and people.

We have have performed data cleaning and data modelling using Microsoft Excel, Power BI and Power Query Editor(DAX).
The Entity Relationship model thus created is then represented using PowerBI DashBoard.

A Dynamic Dashboard is created that provides meaningful insights like sales by segment, top 6 profitable customers ..year wise
